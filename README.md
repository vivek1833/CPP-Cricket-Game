# CPP-Cricket-Game
This project was given to me in during Intershala C and C++ training. In this I build a cricket game application using the C++ programming language.\
There are two teams: TeamA and TeamB and there are two innings. Each team will have 4 players. Each innings will be of 6 balls.\
**OUT criteria:**\
If a batsman scores 0 runs he will be declared OUT and the next batsman in sequence will start batting.\
**Match End criteria:**
> If runs scored by TeamA is greater than the opponent TeamB, then TeamA will win the game or vice-versa.\
> If runs scored by TeamA and TeamB are the same then the match will draw.
